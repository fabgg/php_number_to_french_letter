A basic php function to translate integer to a franch words. Has you know french numbers in words are very particular.
eg. 21 in english will be translate to twenty one, in french it will be vingt **et** un.
there are many other exceptions.

usage :

```php

$string = intergerIntoFrenchWords(71397);
echo $string;

```

will display **soixante-onze mille trois cents quatre-vingt-dix-sept**;

Enjoy !
